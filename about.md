Software is everywhere but reliable software is still rare. We live in a world where software bugs can and do ground planes, block medication from being prescri
bed, block financial transactions from completing etc.

How do we ensure that critical software is reliable, and works as expected in all situations. 100% uptime is impossible but there should be planning for gracefu
l degradation, for creating paths of resilience so that impact of any outages are minimized.

I've learnt a lot over the years working in different aspects of the software lifecycle, for different organizations with varied needs and customer expectations
. I'm going to try and pen down notes on what I learnt, and what I think will be useful for folks interested in this field to be thinking about.
