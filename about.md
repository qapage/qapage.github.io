Software is everywhere but reliable software is still rare. We live in a world w
here software bugs can and do ground planes, block medication from being prescri
bed, block financial transactions from completeing etc.

How do we ensure that critical software is reliable, and works as expected in al
l situations. 100% uptime is impossible but there should be planning for gracefu
l degradation, for creating paths of resilience so that impact of any outages ar
e minimized.

I've learnt a lot over the years working in different aspects of the software li
fecycle, for different organizations with varied needs and customer expectations
. I'm going to try and pen down notes on what I learnt, and what I think will be
 useful for folks interested in this field to be thinking about.
