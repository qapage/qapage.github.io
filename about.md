Hello All! You've come to onsitereliability.com, where I write about things at the intersection of security, resilience and organizational leadership. My day job is in Engineering, where I am in charge of a reliability and security for a SaaS service that handles billions of requests a month. 

### What You'll Find Here

My writing spans three interconnected themes:

#### Technical Depth
From API testing and automation frameworks to emerging technologies like LangChain and Model Context Protocol, I dive into the tools and practices that power modern software. Whether it's Windows automation, Linux command mastery, or cloud infrastructure, I believe in understanding systems deeply.

#### Security & Resilience
As threats evolve, so must our defenses. I write about non-human identities, ransomware awareness, vendor risk, and the operational strategies that keep organizations secure and resilient. Security isn't just technical—it's organizational.

#### Leadership & Strategy
Great products and secure systems don't emerge from technology alone. I explore leadership principles (handling difficult conversations, positive deviance), business strategy frameworks (Porter's Five Forces, Jobs to Be Done, disruptive innovation), and the often-overlooked human elements of building high-performing teams.

### Why This Blend?

Throughout my career, I've discovered that the most impactful solutions live at the intersection of **technical excellence**, **security thinking**, and **organizational acumen**. A perfectly architected system fails without good leadership. A strong team stumbles without understanding strategy. A secure infrastructure collapses if people don't understand the "why."

### Recent Focus Areas

My recent posts reflect a shift toward business acumen and strategic thinking—exploring SaaS terminology, organizational resilience, business frameworks, and AI-assisted development. But I haven't abandoned my technical roots. I still believe that good technologists make better leaders, and good leaders understand technology.
