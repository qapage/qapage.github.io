Software is everywhere, but truly reliable software is still a rare commodity. In a world where a single bug can ground airplanes, prevent medications from being prescribed, or block financial transactions, the stakes are higher than ever.
<br>

So, how can we ensure that critical software is both reliable and works as expected in every scenario? While achieving 100% uptime is an impossible goal, it’s essential to plan for graceful degradation and build resilient systems that minimize the impact of any outages.
<br>

Over the years, I’ve learned a lot from my experience working across various stages of the software lifecycle and with organizations of all sizes, each with their own unique needs and customer expectations. In this space, I’d like to share some of the lessons I’ve learned and offer thoughts on what I believe are important considerations for anyone looking to build and maintain reliable software in today’s world.
