I heard of the Five Forces model first in 2009, in a Business strategy class I took during my (first) MBA. Since then it has remained on the periphery of my thoughts, knowing that it is useful but not using it often enough for it to be second nature. Now nearly 16 years later as I pursue my second MBA, I find myself in a class reading about the Five Forces model again. I am going to take this opportunity to learn it deeply, apply it to many examples, and write about it in an attempt to deepen my understanding of this model and to make it stick.

#### Introduction
Michael Porter, a professor at Harvard Business School, introduced this model in his 1979 book "Competitive Strategy: Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors." Since then, it has become a foundational tool for strategic management and business analysis. In the world of business, understanding the competitive landscape is crucial for success. One of the most widely used frameworks for analyzing competition is Michael Porter's Five Forces Model. This model provides a comprehensive view of the forces that shape competition within an industry and helps businesses develop effective strategies to navigate their market environment.

#### What is Porter's Five Forces Model?
Michael Porter's Five Forces Model is a framework for analyzing the competitive forces within an industry. It helps to understand the dynamics of competition and the potential profitability of a market. The model identifies five key forces that shape the competitive landscape: 
1. **Threat of New Entrants**: The ease or difficulty with which new competitors can enter the market. High barriers to entry can protect existing companies from new competition, while low barriers can lead to increased competition and reduced profitability. 
2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: The power that suppliers have over the prices and terms of supply. If there are few suppliers or if they offer unique products, they can exert significant influence over companies in the industry. 
3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: The power that customers have to influence prices and terms. If buyers are concentrated or if they can easily switch to alternative products, they can negotiate better deals, impacting profitability. 
4. **Threat of Substitute Products or Services**: The likelihood that customers will switch to alternative products or services. High availability of substitutes can limit pricing power and profitability for companies in the industry. 
5. **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**: The intensity of competition among existing players in the market. High rivalry can lead to price wars, increased marketing costs, and reduced profitability.

#### How to Use Porter's Five Forces Model
1. **Identify the Industry**: Clearly define the industry you want to analyze. This could be a specific market segment or a broader industry category.
2. **Analyze Each Force**: Evaluate each of the five forces in the context of the industry. Consider factors such as market size, growth potential, and competitive dynamics.
3. **Assess the Overall Industry Attractiveness**: Based on your analysis, determine the overall attractiveness of the industry. A favorable industry will have low threats from new entrants, strong supplier and buyer power, limited substitutes, and moderate rivalry.
4. **Develop Strategic Recommendations**: Use the insights gained from the analysis to inform strategic decisions. This could include market entry strategies, pricing strategies, or product development initiatives.
5. **Monitor Changes**: The competitive landscape is dynamic, so it's important to regularly revisit the analysis to account for changes in the industry and market conditions.

#### Things to Consider

The Five Forces model is not a static framework. Each part of the framework is bound to change over time, and the model should be revisited periodically to ensure that it reflects the current state of the industry. Additionally, while the Five Forces model provides a comprehensive view of competition, it should be used in conjunction with other strategic analysis tools for a more holistic understanding of the business environment. Sometimes the need to be flexible and adaptable is brought up as a counter point to having a consistent strategy. I think this is a false dichotomy. A consistent strategy can be flexible and adaptable. The key is to have a clear understanding of the competitive landscape and to be willing to adjust your approach as needed. This requires ongoing analysis and monitoring of the industry, as well as a willingness to learn from both successes and failures.
