#### The Crucial Conversations framework for handling difficult conversations

##### Awareness

The first step to handling difficult conversations is to be aware of
when they start happening and to be aware of your behavior when in the
midst of such a conversation. The book "Crucial Conversations" defines
these conversations as,

*The day to day conversations that affect your life. They have 
the following characteristics: Opposing opinions, Strong emotions
and High stakes.*

The results of these conversations could have a huge impact on your lives.
Despite the importance of these conversations, we some times back away
from having them. We remain silent, we send email, we leave voicemails, we
 change the topic! Given how important these are and how much of an impact
 these could have on us, we surprisingly don't do well at them. In fact,
 we are on our worst behavior. We default to a primitive state where
 emotion takes over, adrenaline + the fight/flight drive kicks in. We
 resort to sarcasm, thinly veiled attacks, passive aggression etc.

##### Leaders: don't avoid hard conversations
Leaders don't always directly address issues because they are not
comfortable having those conversations. Numbers are easy, reports are
easy but talking to human beings especially when delivering negative
feedback is not easy and leaders tend to avoid or postphone them. They
sometimes just work around the problem by changing policies, processes,
KPI's etc.

It's also not fair to those employees who are missing out on hearing
feedback that could tell them where they need to improve, how they could
fix things etc etc. Today's world is one where everyone learns and
improves and does bigger + better things. If we do not give folks the
opportunity to learn everday, from things they do everyday, how do we
ensure success? How do we go about building a high performing team with
this critical piece missing?

##### Free flow of information
The best chance of working successfully through a difficult conversation
is to ensure free flow of information. Once all the potential
information that could affect a decision or a viewpoint is on the table,
a decision made then, could be the closest thing to the right decision.
The other benefit of having everyone share their thoughts and opinions
before making a decision is that people support the decision, once its
made. For people to buy in to the decision, having been part of its
making is a great plus.

##### Fools choices
When all the information is on the table, there's also a better chance
of avoiding Fool's choices. *Fools choices are when you believe you need 
to choose from one of two bad options.*

For example, you may feel like you need to choose between being honest
and being truthful, when you don't really have to choose one or the
other. You can do both at the same time. With some free flow of
information, you may actually realize that there are more options than
you initially realized, going into the discussion. Listening to other's
thoughts may actually help your realize why they think that way, that
they are not really wrong and how your initial options may have been
formed based on incomplete information. When you get all the information
out during a discussion, before a decision, you are building the pool of
shared meaning.

##### A shared pool of meaning

*The pool of meaning: each of us enters conversations with our
opinions, feelings, theories and experiences about the topic at hand.
This is our pool of meaning, this is what drives us in certain ways and
in certain directions.*

When we start the conversation, we may not share the same pool of
meaning. We are all operating from our own private pools. Once we start
discussing, start sharing openingly the pool grows. All the information
that would have otherwise remained in our heads and affected how we view
the decision is now part of a public pool that others share. Individuals
are now exposed to more accurate and relevant information. They can now
make better choices with the better information they now have.

##### Putting it all together
When you provide a forum for discussion and to honestly air your views,
there's a good chance that people will talk about their ideas or what's
bothering them about a certain solution. This gives the group and you as
a manager to address their concerns and thus come to a mutually
agreeable conclusion. You are able to move people from quietly
criticizing + passively resisting to openly discussion + actively
supporting the decision.
