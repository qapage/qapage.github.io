#### The Crucial Conversations framework for handling difficult conversations

##### What are Crucial conversations?

*They’re the day to day conversations that are affecting your life. They have the following characteristics: Opposing opinions, Strong emotions, High stakes.* 

The results of these conversations could have a huge impact on your lives. Despite the importance of these conversations, we some times back away from having them. We remain silent, we send email, we leave voicemails, we change the topic!

When it matters most, we do our worst. Because we default to a primitive state where emotion takes over, adrenaline + the fight/flight drive kicks in. We resort to sarcasm, thinly veiled attacks, passive aggression etc.

Leaders some times restructure to address performance issues. They change policies, processes, KPI’s etc because human nature is just too messy to deal with. Personnel issues are ignored and then transferred to others. Rarely are issues like performance issues addressed head on. We can learn to directly address and try to resolve these situations by learning how to handle crucial conversations.

Avoiding fool's choices

Fools choices are when you beleive you need to choose between one of two equally bad options.
For example, how can I be 100% honest and at the same time 100% respectful of someone, when giving feedback? Does it always need to be a choice between being honest and being respectful? No. Achieve dialogue, enable the free flow of information rather than make a fools choice.

The pool of shared meaning: each of us enters conversations with our own opinions, feelings, theories and experiences about the topic at hand. This pool informs us and also propels our action. When enter a crucial conversation, we don’t share the same pool. Our opinions differ, our ideas differ. As the pool of shared meaning grows, individuals are exposed to more accurate and relevant information and can then make better choices. And since the meaning is shared, everyone involved in the decision willingly acts on whatever decisions they make - with unity and conviction. You get buy in.

When people are not involved, they sit back during touchy discussions and they’ve not committed to the final decision. Their ideas remain in their head and their opinions rarely make it into the pool. They end up quietly criticizing and passively resisting.

When stakes are high, opinions vary and emotions run strong, we are often at our worst. In order to move to our best, we need to find a way to explain what is in each of our personal pool of meaning - especially our high stakes, sensitive and controversial opinions, feelings and ideas and get other to share their pool. We have to develop the tools that make it safe for us to discuss these issues and to come to a shared pool of meaning.
