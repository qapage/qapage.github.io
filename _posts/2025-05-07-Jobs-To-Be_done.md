##### The Jobs to be done Framework
The Jobs to be done framework is a powerful tool for understanding customer needs and driving innovation. It focuses on the "job" that a customer is trying to accomplish, rather than the product or service itself. By identifying the job, companies can create solutions that better meet customer needs.

##### Five questions to uncover jobs your customers need help with
1. Do you have a job that needs to be done?
2. Where do you see nonconsumption?
3. What work-arounds have people invented?
4. What tasks do people want to avoid?
5. What surprising uses have customers invented for existing products?
