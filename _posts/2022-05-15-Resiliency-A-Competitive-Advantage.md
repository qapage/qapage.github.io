TLDR; Resiliency is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; 
toughness.

#### Businesses are complex systems

#### And complex systems fail.

* lots of failure modes
* complex systems run in degraded modes
* catastrophic failure requires multiple failures but is always around the corner

If you're trying to avoid failure, its unfortunately not going to happen.
