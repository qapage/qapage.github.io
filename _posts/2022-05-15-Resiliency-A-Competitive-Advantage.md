TLDR; Resiliency is the capacity to recover quickly from difficulties; 
toughness.

#### Businesses are complex systems
When you start out, you have one idea, one simple system that does what you originally set out to do. Then you grow successful, you have more customers, you add more features, you add more reporting capabilities, you add more dependencies inside and outside your company, you add more vendors and use third party services.

Your simple system is not so simple any more. It is a complex system now.

#### And complex systems fail.
* lots of failure modes
* complex systems run in degraded modes
* catastrophic failure requires multiple failures but is always around the corner
All those vendors, all those dependencies, those interacting systems, those data feeds that power your reports, your machine learning algorithms, those logging capabilities etc etc, each of them add failure vectors to your system.

Your system now has lots of failure modes. And given how many of those exist, you're probably not even aware of all the little failures that are constantly happening across your system. That is, your system is probably running in a degraded state a lot more than you know. You only notice when the degradation becomes bigger.

Maybe not one single failure but a chain of small failures tied together, form a catastrophic failure.
