Disruption is a process by which smaller companies with less resources successfully challenge established businesses. The term was coined by Clayton Christensen in his 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma".

Successful businesses understand the needs of their customers and build products on satisfying the most demanding of those customers. This leaves them blind to or too busy for less demanding customers or markets.

The disruptive process typically follows this pattern:

* Small companies enter with simpler, cheaper products targeting overlooked segments
* Established companies ignore these entrants because the segments appear unprofitable
* New entrants gradually improve their offerings and move upmarket
* Eventually, they displace the incumbents

The distinction between sustaining innovation (improving existing products for current customers) and disruptive innovation (creating new markets with different value propositions) is crucial for strategic decision-making.

Understanding the true nature of disruption matters because it helps companies identify genuine threats and respond appropriately before it's too late. Small competitors on a disruptive trajectory require immediate attention, while those simply operating at the edges may not pose the same level of threat.
