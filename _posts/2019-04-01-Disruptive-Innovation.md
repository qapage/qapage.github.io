Disruption describes a process where a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established businesses. Disruption occurs when a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established businesses. The term was coined by Clayton Christensen in his 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma".

What makes business successful, namely understanding the needs of their customers and building products that meet those needs, can also make them vulnerable to disruption. Established companies tend to focus on improving their existing products and services for their most demanding customers, which can lead them to overlook the needs of less demanding customers or new markets. This can also mean that they exceed the expectations of certains and fail to meet the need for others. This creates an opportunity for smaller companies to enter the market with simpler, cheaper products that meet the needs of these overlooked customers. These entrants start small, focussed on certain underserved segments and then gradually move upmarket, eventually displacing the established companies. In the early days these segements are not attractive to the established companies, but as the new entrants improve their products and services, they begin to take market share from the established companies. This is known as the "disruption curve".

##### Key characteristics of Christensen's definition include:
* Disruptive innovations often start in low-end or new-market footholds that incumbents overlook
* Incumbent companies typically focus on "sustaining innovations" - improving existing products for their most profitable customers
* Disruptive products are often simpler, more convenient, and less expensive than existing offerings
* Incumbents frequently fail to respond effectively because serving the lower-end market appears less profitable initially

##### What to read to learn more about this topic?

<em> Why does the definition of Disruptive Innovation matter so much? What happens if we work off of a slightly different definition? </em>
<em> It matters because unless we grasp its true nature, we are unable to manage it or respond to it. </em>

Small competitors nibbling away at the edges of your business can be ignored unless they are on a disruptive trajectory. If they are, they need to be addressed before its too late. If these small competitors start improving their products and services, the quality of their offerings, and the breadth of their offerings, to the point where they become attractive to a wider subset of your customers, they are about to disrupt your business and need to be addressed immediately.

Understanding the definition of Disruptive Innovation can help companies make a strategic choice between taking a sustaining path and a disruptive path. Sustaining innovation is about improving existing products and services for existing customers, while disruptive innovation is about creating new markets and new customers. Sustaining innovation has high margins and targets large customer segments, while disruptive innovation has low margins and targets small customer segments. Sustaining innovation is about improving existing products and services, while disruptive innovation is about creating new markets and new customers. Sustaining innovation is about improving existing products and services for existing customers, while disruptive innovation is about creating new markets and new customers. Sustaining innovation has high margins and targets large customer segments, while disruptive innovation has low margins and targets small customer segments.
